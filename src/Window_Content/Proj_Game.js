            During the lockdown of may 2020 I decided to make my child dream come true and make a game. I started the the project and learnt skills such as UX/UI and art. <br />
            However the more features added the more I figured out that using Python may have been a bad idea. By fixing most of the optimizations the game became playable again! <br /> 
            I really want to continue and finish this game but sadly the amount of time needed to make a game alone it too high.

              You wake up in an obscure dungeon, they are no way out except to continue forward. Pick up your sword and go explore the dungeon while trying to survive the enemy! Use the coins you collect on them to equip yourself better.<br />
              But take care of the shadow of the dungeon, you donâ€™t know what hide behind the doors. <br />
              Pretty original duh?

In fact, the heuristic was uncommon, the mob can not move to win as quick as possible as it could be frustrating for the player, it should also not behave in a too bad way as it is no challenge for the player.  </p>

                            <p>Coins was also a strange point and the realization was quite mathematical, from coins dropping to coins picking I tried to make it as satisfying as possible.</p>
                            <p><br />Sword using was also a tricky part as the sword position and angle is calculated based on both the player position, mouse position and attack. Because this formula is run every frame it was needed to be optimized as much as possible.</p>

                            <p className="game_light_txt">Indisputably the hardest part was to create the light I inspired myself of shaders to create it. It is not perfect by any means but it us player position to calculate the area that should be lighted (no darker shade) and item of a class to be shadow creator. It was optimized to not process every pixels but work with quadrilateral.</p>
