            During the lockdown of may 2020 I decided to make my child dream come true and make a game. I started the the project and learnt skills such as UX/UI and art. <br />
            However the more features added the more I figured out that using Python may have been a bad idea. By fixing most of the optimizations the game became playable again! <br /> 
            I really want to continue and finish this game but sadly the amount of time needed to make a game alone it too high.

              You wake up in an obscure dungeon, they are no way out except to continue forward. Pick up your sword and go explore the dungeon while trying to survive the enemy! Use the coins you collect on them to equip yourself better.<br />
              But take care of the shadow of the dungeon, you donâ€™t know what hide behind the doors. <br />
              Pretty original duh?
